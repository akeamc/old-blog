## Introduction

I was thinking the other day about how we should reduce our carbon emissions, and I think that I have come up with a pretty clever idea. It won't save the environment, but it might help consumers to not emit quite as much as today. It's simple, really.

[According to the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/1180.pdf), 10 percent of their greenhouse gas emissions came from agriculture in 2016 and 24 percent from transportation. To reduce these emissions, I believe that it is wise to add numbers to products.

## The plan

I believe that companies should take more responsibility of informing their customers about the product's effect on the environment. Sure, FSC, MSC, and other environment certificates are great. But we must focus more on the greenhouse gas emissions. By declaring the total of carbon dioxide equivalents that was emitted into the atmosphere in order to produce and transport the product, people will be able to rethink what to purchase.

Components of a product, even those that only are used during manufacturing, should be treated exactly as the final product in terms of the way emissions are calculated. For example, the emissions from producing and shipping the battery pack should be included in the total emissions of a car. Likewise, the emissions of the cells in the earlier mentioned battery pack should be declared just like the total emissions of the car.

The numbers should not be hard to access. In fact, they should be listed right next to the price tag in a grocery store or at least on the product box. Car manufacturers should show the emissions like they are showing the emissions of a car today.

## More stuff

An EU energy label could be used to guide the consumers. This would make it even easier to compare food, two car models or two trips with two different aircraft.

If just notifying the customers about the greenhouse gas emissions isn't effective enough, authorities may introduce higher or lower taxes on the product depending on the carbon dioxide equivalents. This would also push companies to make more sustainable products and be careful with shipping.
