# Story

Google Fonts is a great resource for fonts to use on one's website. The fonts are well-made, easy to add to a site and, to me, most important: They are free to use commercially. More and more (huge) corporations are designing their own typefaces (Netflix Sans, Google Sans, etc.), and they all have one thing in common: They are all sans serif. I searched Google Fonts for hours looking for a good sans serif font, but they all had a few properties that I wasn't a fan of. For instance, [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) has weird thin joints, [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)'s glyphs are too wide and [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) has rounded terminals that in my opinion doesn't fit. Other than that, they are all great fonts.

Then I came across [this blog post](https://fontsarena.com/blog/free-graphik-font-alternatives/), "Free Graphik font alternatives in 2019" by Fonts Arena. I quickly scrolled through the page, stopping at the first font, Hanken Grotesk. I looked at the comparison, thinking "this is too good to be true". Unlike all of the other fonts that I had considered, this one was completely free, even for commercial use! Apart from the fact that Hanken Grotesk uses the alternative lowercase g (which is a small price to pay), it's simply perfect. It comes with multiple weights and covers many languages. Also, it fulfills my goal: To find a font that is very similar to Google Sans.

After downloading the newly discovered font, I went to [Fontsquirrel's Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) to generate a web font to use on this blog.
