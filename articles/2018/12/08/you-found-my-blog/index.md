# Things you should know

- I use double quotes (`"`) in my code snippets and the source code. Deal with it. ðŸ˜Ž
- Get used to the metric system.
- I'm not a master of programming.

# What I will post

If you are interested in programming, this is a blog that you should read. *If it's any good.* I'm currently in the process of coding this blog, and I'm writing this post before the blog even is ready.

# Me

In the time of writing this, I am 13 years old. I've been a fan of computers ever since my parents bought me my first one for my eighth birthday, an ASUS Desktop. In the beginning, I had a hard time *connecting the monitor to the computer*. I don't want to call myself a pro, but I'm certainly more used to computers now than I was five years ago. I've coded in JavaScript since the beginning^1^. More recently, I have gained an interest in Linux, Docker and system administration in general.

^1^Actually, I learnt HTML and CSS before I learnt JavaScript, but I don't count those as *programming* languages.

# Now, what?

First of all, thank you for reading my blog.

```js
while(true) {
  console.log("Thank you for reading!");
}

// Don't actually add this to your website. It will impact performance, trust me.
```


I have no idea how often or rarely I will post, or what I will blog about exactly. I will let you, the readers, judge. *What do you want me to blog about?*
