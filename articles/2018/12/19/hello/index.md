# Me

Hello everyone! I'm Sigrid Masterbard, ThePicoNerd's little sister. I like horses and play Star Stable Online (that I probably will refer to as "SSO" in the future) and started to play in 2016 when I was 8 years old. For those wondering, I'm on [Fluffy Unicorn](http://jorvikipedia.wikia.com/wiki/Fluffy_Unicorn), and won't move for a while. I'm at level 20 and have 19 horses at the moment, in SSO of course.

# What I will write

I will write about Star Stable's updates and how I feel about them. I will also write a bit about what I do on Star Stable, for example "I bought a chestnut Hanoverian whose name is Blueborn".

I hope you like my blog. It will be fun to write!
